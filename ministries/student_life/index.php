      <h2>Mission</h2>
     <p> Our heart is simple; Learn who He is. Love like He Loves. Live the life He’s called us to. Life was meant to be lived, and we believe, that by showing students how to live they can experience real relationship with God. Often the world tries to make things seem harder then they truly are, we help students see it for what it truly is.</p>
      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Life is a ministry focused on students. Everything we do is about taking students to the next level. 
      Our weekly services on Wednesday nights provide an atmosphere for high school and junior high students to 
      bring their friends and connect in a way that is relevant to today's progressive culture. Check us out 
      on Wednesday nights in the Life Church Student Center. </p>
