      • First Fruits - In Proverbs 3:9 we are taught to honor the Lord with the "First 
      Fruits" of our labor. By setting up a recurring contribution that is scheduled to 
      come out of your account on the day you specify you can ensure that your
      First Fruits are given back to God. <br>
      <br>
      • Simplicity - You will not need to remember if you gave this month or send in 
      your offering checks when you are out of town. <br>

      <br>
      • Security - Online giving is more secure than giving with a check in that an 
      electronic gift can't be lost or stolen. <br>
      <br>
      • No Distractions - Instead of needing to worry about writing your contribution 
      check during the service, you can be fully engaged with the worship service, 
      knowing that you have already given your offering. <br>
      <br>
      • Helping Life Church - Online contributions require less processing from our 
      administrative staff since the information is logged and deposited 
      automatically.</p>
