   <h2>The Vision</h2>     
    <p>  Ever play tag as a kid?  Once you were tagged, the goal was to do everything you could to tag someone else.  This fall, join in one giant game of tag at Life Church.  If you’re a Christ Follower, you have all been tagged by Jesus to “go into all the world” and tag those who are far from God.  The challenge is simple: Who are 5 people that you are going to attempt to tag this fall?  These 5 people could be family members, coworkers, friends, etc.  Your job is to invest in them relationally, pray for them daily, and invite them to come to church with you.  If you’d like to add a name to or view this list (first names only), click on the “Who’s Being Tagged?” tab on the right.  Along the way, we would love to hear about your “Tag You’re It” story.  To do so, click on the “Share Your Story” tab to the right. </p>
