   <p>Several weeks ago a friend of my husband's from work joined us for dinner and then the Saturday evening service at LifeChurch; his name is Mike. Mike is about the nicest young man you would ever want to meet, kind, thoughtful, a hard worker and intensely curious about Jesus. Pastor often discribes guests at our church as 'kicking the tires' on being a Christ Follower. That was Mike. He knew what was being placed before him and I believe he even understood he was being called but he was holding himself back, he just wasn't quite ready to leap off the cliff and say, I hear you and I want to follow you, I know you are real and have your hand on me. Mike listened intently that evening, even asked a question on his communication card. He loved the worship service and the gospel message presented but he did not make a decision for Christ that evening. Mike had another friend who attended a bible believing Church and often invited him to church as well. Mike went. My husband found out the next day at work that Mike had made his decision, he answered the one who was knocking at the door to his hear and accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior.</p>

   <p>My best friend Cassie has such an open heart and mind and is very eager and willing to learn more about this amazing God I've been telling her so much about. Unfortunately due to her parents and tight schedule she hasn't been able to attend many church events with me. Time after time i continue to invite her to church on a daily basis. This past week, before I got to ask her to church, SHE called ME eager with news. She was so excited that she finally had an opening in her busy schedule this week, and her parents allowed it, that she called me to let me know she was coming to church with me. She rearranged all her plans prior to this Wednesday just so she could come to youth group with me. I am so excited to see what is going to happen next, God always shows up with new surprises and I'm loving it.</p>

   <p>I have lived in our house for just over 4 years now. We live next to a single mom named DoRelle and her grown son and teenage daughter. We have been slowly witnessing to them in that time. We have had many interesting conversations, ones that I have not always had the answers to. She has come to Life Church on a couple of occasions and is feeling closer to God. While I don't believe she has taken the step to commit her life fully to God yet, I was encouraged when today, she came over and said she wants to start going with her daughter more often, become involved, and that she needed to get a Bible she could understand! I gave her mine. I am so stoked for her!</p>

   <p>I have been working on my adult daughter for years. She has been in a very non-Christian environment for many years, and tries to do what is right, but has not accepted Jesus. Her influences are not ones that will bring her close to Him. Just recently she has been asking for me to pray for her. It is a simple step, but one that is producing fruit.</p>
   
   <h3>Bethany</h3>
   <p>One of my best friends told me in our freshman year of high school that she didn't care about God, Christianity or any form of 'religion.' But just this past week, two years later, she was at See You at the Pole- a day where high school students gather around their flag pole and pray before school- and even prayed! I don't know if she really believed it, but it was so great to see her there and praying.</p>

   <p>Janelle is my friend. We have worked together now for 3 years. She calls me her religious work friend:) She has told me a zillion times that there is something different about me. She asked me some questions about God at work the other day, and I invited her to church but she was busy that weekend. Please pray for her. I know she is close to coming with me to church. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.-Romans 8:28</p>
   
   <h3>Tammy</h3>
   <p>I have been inviting (practically begging) my friend Valerie to church for months and months. She is a mom to a three year old son and dating the son's father who is an atheist. She wants to have her son baptized but the father does not. She finally came to church with me for the 10 year celebration service. The first thing she said was, "This is like a concert, we should have brought some glow sticks! :)" At another point during the service she said, "I can't stop crying." I know God is at work in her life. I think I cried every service for the first year I went to life church. She is an amazing person, an amazing mom and has voiced that she knows the God piece is missing in her life. She was thrilled with the card sent to her after she attended the service and intends to come back with me again. I keep praying for her and her family, knowing God only has great things in store for them. Thank you life church for making a difference in people's lives!!!</p>

   <p>I have the fortune of working with high school students. One particular student and I have had some great conversations. Today, however, God had put on my heart that I needed to talk specifically to this student about a relationship with God. He thought he was possibly a Christian, but when we got down to it, he admitted that he didn't really have a relationship with God. It was such a great conversation and he spent a lot of time talking about where he was in life...and I listened. I think that meant a lot to him. He used an analogy about having this invitation from God. I asked why he hadn't responded. He stated he wasn't sure what the invitation was for. I made it clear to him that the invitation was asking him to have a relationship with God...for eternity. He didn't make a decision right there...but I know God is working.</p>

   <p>Well Im sorry to say that Hildy has passed this morning and unfortunately its a case where we have to wait until that day to see whether she is in heaven. I just want to say "Thank you" for all those that along with me and my family, never gave up and continued to pray for her.</p>

   <p>Tyrell literally fell into our window on the second floor of the warehouse in Milwaukee. It's a fun story to tell. We were there working soon after we got the keys to the building, and it was after midnight. We had stopped to take a break on the second floor where there was heat. Soon, we heard someone banging on one of the boarded-up windows. We announced our presence, but the person continued to force their way in. We went to the window and asked a few questions. Tyrell eventually asked if he could come in (since he was hanging off the window ledge in the freezing cold). We held the board so he could get in without it falling on him, and he climbed up and in head first. That's how we met the first person in the neighborhood - Tyrell. He is 18, enjoys catching wild animals in his neighborhood, and loves cake. He and his family need the unconditional, life-changing love of God in their lives. He is drawn to us, and I know that God is reeling him in... </p>

   <p>None of my family is saved and I feel urged to share the gospel with them - especially my mom...She believes in a "god" but pulls her faith from a huge array of sources - other religions & faiths, even "energy force" ideas. Over the past 12 months I have treaded gently but firmly to offer an alternative truth to this 70 year old person I love...Today, out of the blue, I get a devotional forwarded TO me FROM her - not the other way around - with a simple questioning response note attached...I know there is a long journey yet ahead, but I am so encouraged! Fortunately I know God is up to the task as long as I keep extending "my hand" and let Him work through me...</p>
